NEMO-RELOC's documentation
##########################

Relocatable NEMO configurations. The central aim of this documentation is to
help save time so that you can do other things.

The following code base uses a version of NEMO that is in precedes v4 but is
after v3.6. In many ways the dynamics are still at v3.6 but the configuration setup
is the same as v4. In NEMOv4 the domain configuration setup is abstracted
from the code base as a preprocessing step. This is an essential process when
building a new configuration. We therefore refer to the codebase
used herein as vp4 (preceding v4), or the ORCHESTRA branch, as it was developed
for a NERC project ORCHESTRA `(NE/N018095/1) <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE%2FN018095%2F1>`_
As well as a specific version of NEMO, this documentation was targeted at
running on the ARCHER HPC (www.archer.ac.uk). Though the principles are transferrable.

The documentation is divided into sections. As an introduction and overview to
the process, the first section contains the recipe specific for the 1/12 deg SE
Asia configuration. The second section contains a number of common modules, or
steps, that are described in more detail and that are part of the build process
 but are not specific to any particular configuration. Section 3 addresses some common trouble shooting
issues. Section 4 presents some simple diagnostics tools for visualising output,
and Section 5 presents recipes from some other configurations.

When a new note file is created manually add it to this list to aid finding it.

3. Common Modules:
*******************

These common modules are used in the configuration recipes. They are generally
abstracted as _modules_ when the process is common to more than one configuration.

Not sure how to do this currently have a few repo python scripts that might

5. Other configurations:
************************

We could add other configuration recipes here.

* SANH - Jenny's wiki is nicely put together (Physics only)

* EAfrica: This configuration was generated by jdha and valegu for the ACCORD proposal,
using vp4. This recipe ports and runs that domain to the local user. The code is
compiled but forcings are taken from jdha. The new domain_cfg.nc is generated
in the recipe. This is a tide only simulation.

* LBay_180m: In vp4 a significant challenge is in getting the new namelists to
work. Having made progress in LBay_livljobs4 on branch
 ``LBay-orchestra-code-base`` but run into GRIDGEN problems. Decided to make a
 new branch and start with the old 180m POLCOMS bathymetry and coordinates file
  for Liverpool Bay. This gets a new branch (incase we fix the GRIDGEN problem).
 At the time of writing this is where I am. *(16 Oct)*:
